# Test script for the Rust version of Cline Auth Service
# This script tests the full authentication flow by:
# 1. Fetching an access token from the local auth service.
# 2. Using that token to make a real API call to the Cline chat completions endpoint.
#
# Prerequisites:
# - The auth-service must be running (`cargo run --release` in the auth-service-rust directory).
# - You must have completed the login flow in your browser.
# - `jq` must be installed to parse the JSON response. (On macOS: `brew install jq`)

echo "Attempting to fetch access token from local auth service..."

# 1. Fetch the token and extract it from the JSON response.
# The -s flag makes curl silent.
ACCESS_TOKEN=$(curl -s http://localhost:8888/token | jq -r .access_token)

    echo "Please ensure the auth-service is running and you have logged in."
    exit 1
fi

echo "Access token retrieved successfully."
echo "Making a test API call to Cline's chat completions endpoint..."

# 2. Use the token to make an authenticated API request.
# We are sending a simple, non-streaming request to a default model.
# Note: Based on the original Cline extension code, we need specific headers
